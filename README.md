## Description

R packages are a powerful way to share code and data across your
individual projects, with colleagues, or even with the broader
scientific community. They can also form the basis for a Research
Compendium to share data analysis work reproducibly. This workshop will
introduce the basics of creating custom R packages for personal use and
for sharing\!

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

  - create working R packages with code and data
  - write documentation using `roxygen2`
  - describe additional package-related tools (e.g. `pkgdown`,
    `testthat`)
