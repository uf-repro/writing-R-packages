## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("create working R packages with code and data", 
                       "write documentation using `roxygen2`",
                       "describe additional package-related tools (e.g. `pkgdown`, `testthat`)")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`
